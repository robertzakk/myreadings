# 📖 My Readings
My readings is a full-stack website made by [Robert Zak](http://youtube.com).

## 📘 Post Your Books
The main purpose of this website is for users to being able to log into their account,
and have a neat way of registering their books by fetching real-time book data from [Open Library](https://openlibrary.org/).

You can also search up other users that have registered on the website, and take a look at their favorite books.

## 🗒️ Take Notes
In addition to registering books, you can also take notes for each book, how neat?

## 🖥️ Local Installation
To run the application on your own computer, you will need to download [***node JS***](https://nodejs.org/en) in the project's directory.

Once that's installed, you need to run ```node install``` or simply ```node i``` into your project's directory to install the application's dependancies.

Finally, you can run ```node start_server``` to automatically execute the application's Private APIs and main index.js program, making your own computer act as the server for the website.

The server is hosted on port ```4000```, and uses ```localhost``` as the application's host, so after starting the server, you can go to ```http://localhost:4000``` and you're set.
